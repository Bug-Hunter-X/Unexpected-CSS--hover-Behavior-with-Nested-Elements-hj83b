The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an unusual error related to the specificity of CSS selectors and how they interact with the :hover pseudo-class.  The intent is to change the background color of the list items on hover, but the hover state is not being applied correctly.

```css
.nav ul li {
  background-color: white;
}

.nav ul li:hover {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

.nav ul li a {
  color: black;
}

.nav ul li a:hover {
  color: darkblue;
}
```

The problem arises because the `a` element's :hover state is inheriting the specificity of its parent, and the specificity is higher than just `.nav ul li:hover` causing the `background-color` change to be overridden.
